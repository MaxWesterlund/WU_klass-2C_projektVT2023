            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Max Westerlund, and I am a game developer who specializes in using Unity and C# to create immersive and engaging games. I have a passion for exploring various concepts through my games, and I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting ideas to incorporate into my projects. <br> <br>
                
                With a focus on creating games that are both entertaining and thought-provoking, I strive to provide players with a unique and memorable gaming experience. I believe that games have the power to inspire and connect people from all walks of life, and I am committed to using my skills to create games that are inclusive and accessible to all. <br> <br>
                
                Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I look forward to sharing my latest game projects with you soon!
            </p>

            <h1>My Software</h1>
            <p>
                As a Unity game developer, I find Visual Studio Code to be an incredibly useful code editor. Its customizable interface and powerful features make it easy to write and debug code directly within the editor. Plus, it supports the primary language used in Unity development - C# - making it a perfect choice for my workflow. <br> <br>

In addition to Visual Studio Code, I also rely on GitHub to manage my projects and collaborate with other developers. The version control system allows me to keep track of changes made to code over time, which is especially important when working on large projects with other team members. With GitHub, I can easily share my code with others and showcase my work to the wider community. <br> <br>

Overall, the combination of Visual Studio Code and GitHub provides me with a powerful toolset that makes Unity game development much more efficient and collaborative. I highly recommend these tools to any other Unity developers looking to improve their workflow and streamline their projects.
